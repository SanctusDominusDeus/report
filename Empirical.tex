We proceed to follow the \textcite{barrot_globalization_2019} methodology to calculate the shipping costs. They have provided the \textit{Stata} code and part of the raw data in their \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111\%2Fjofi.12780&file=jofi12780-sup-0002-code.zip}{Internet appendix}. 

As the main data sources for the shipping costs, we used the \textcite{feenstra_us_1996} for 1974 to 1988 and the Peter Schott’s \href{https://sompks4.github.io/sub_data.html}{website} data for 1989 to 2014. After cleaning and merging the dataset with the same assumption as \textcite{barrot_globalization_2019}, we obtain the following summary statistics for the 439 industries analysed (Table 1 – \textit{Stata} output:

Our replication results are almost identical, with the exception that we end up with less 16 observations, even when using their \textit{Stata} code (table 1). But these seems not to influence the main distribution metrics.
