\section{Conclusions}%\label{qmod}
The Globalization Risk Premium used the shipping costs as proxy for the international competition on the domestic market.  

Most of their citations followed this logic, adding some additional metrics to measure market competition. However, their methodology fails to consider the non-financial shipping costs and to develop a more detailed analysis.   

Finally, there is still room to develop our approach either by using the same data in a different way, add the non-financial costs or to use the navigation data as proxy for international trade flows.
